# Pos ApplÄ±cation
The main purpose of the website is to provide users with a seamless experience in discovering and purchasing high-quality jewelry.The website allows users to add their favorite items to the cart, facilitating a convenient shopping experience.
The cart enables users to securely store their preferred items and make bulk purchases at their convenience.Detailed descriptions and high-quality images are provided for each jewelry product, allowing users to gain insights into the product.



## Usage

In my POS application project, I can add the desired products to the cart and view and assess the invoices for each item separately. There is a separate category for each product, making it easy for users to navigate and find the items they need. I aimed to create a system where I can easily shop and complete the invoicing process.
